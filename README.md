# NYC_air_quality
An analysis of how air quality differs across New York City.  
Pollutants can have a major impact on younger people, people with asthma, oor anyone who is regularly exposed to them, namely people that live in an area with high pollution. With that being said, having a catalog of how rates of pollution have changed over time can help people make informed choices about where to loko for housing, and help policy makers and scientists determine the effectiveness of initiatives to lower air pollution.

The presentation slides provided here will lagely be focsing on a few main areas in NYC such as Manhattan, Statten Island, and the city as a whole. However, graphs for every area noted in the dataset can be found in the images folder.

## How to use this repo
Within the imagesfolder you will find 4 sub-folders, each corresponoding to a different pollutant. Ozone (O3), Sulfur Dioxide (SO2), Nitrite (NO2), and general fine particles.  
  
### NO2 & SO2
the original dataset (linked in the sources file) tracked the prevalence of NO2 and SO2 in differnt areas of NYC over time.For each of those areas, there will be a line graph deatiling the change in the levels of the pullutant over time.  
  
### O3 & Fine Particles
Within both of these folders, you will find 3 different sub-folders. measures, deaths, and emergencies. Measures tracks the same thing as the previous 2 pollutants, the change in levels over time. Deaths track the change in death rates from this specific pollutant over time, while emergencies tracks the number of emergency room visits over time.

The link to the original dataset, as well as the CDCs articles on each pollutant can be found in the sources markdown file.
